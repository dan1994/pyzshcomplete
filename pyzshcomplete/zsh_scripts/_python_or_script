#compdef -p python[0-9.]#

# The purpose of this script is to catch command lines of the form
# `python script.py` before they are passed to the builtin _python completion
# function.
# By doing this we can affect the completion flow in 2 ways:
# 1. Backup the original words array that is manipulated by _python before the
#    _python_script function is invoked.
# 2. Make sure that _normal doesn't fallback to default matches when it
#    shouldn't. This can't be done by setting _compskip at _python_script
#    because it will not be in the correct scope.

_python_or_script() {
  # Save a backup of words
  local __pyzshcomplete_orig_words
  _python_script_words_backup

  # Call _python directly and avoid default fallbacks
  _python "$@" && _compskip=all
}

_python_script_words_backup() {
    __pyzshcomplete_orig_words=$words
}
